# Download tools

**Before** the first laboratory session, we ask you to download two specific tools, i.e. Python and PyCharm, that will be used during the laboratory and, generally speaking, during the whole course. You have only to download them, while we will install them all together during the first laboratory session.

## Python
1. Navigate to the Python Downloads page: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). It will show *Download the latest version of Python* according to the OS you are using to access the browser.
2. Click on the **download** button to get the latest version of **Python (3.9)**.

### On Windows
Alternatively, you can navigate to the Python Releases for Windows page ([https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)) and select *Download Windows x86-64 executable installer* from the list of releases under the Python 3.9.0 - Oct. 5, 2020 label.

### On Mac
The download should start without any redirection.

### On Linux
Linux users can skip this part and don't download the installer of Python. Since on the installation phase, we are going to use the Advanced Package Tool (APT) which will download and install the Python repository in one step.

## PyCharm
1. Go to the PyCharm home page: [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
2. Press the **Download** button in the up-right corner, which redirects you to the download page, according to the OS you are using to access the browser (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
3. Under the label *Community*, press **Download**.
